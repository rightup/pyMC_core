    According to the official documentation, PATH packets are used for returning
    responses through the mesh network along discovered routing paths.

    Official Packet Structure:
    - Header [1B]: Route type (0-1) + Payload type (2-5) + Version (6-7)
    - Path Length [1B]: Length of the path field
    - Path [up to 64B]: Routing path data (if applicable)
    - Payload [up to 184B]: The actual data being transmitted

    For PATH packets, the payload typically contains:
    - [1B] dest_hash: Destination node hash
    - [1B] src_hash: Source node hash
    - [2B] MAC: Message Authentication Code (for payload version 0x00)
    - [NB] encrypted_data: Contains ACK or other response data
