    A single result type lets callers — the local node, the companion bridge,
    and the repeater router — make one consistent forwarding decision instead of
    interpreting handler-specific return values. New fields can be added here
    without touching call sites that only care about ``authenticated``.

    Attributes:
        authenticated: True once the packet was MAC-verified/decrypted for a
            concrete local identity, so the caller must consume it (stop
            forwarding) even when there is no reply. False means no local
            identity proved ownership — e.g. a one-byte prefix collision — and
            the caller must leave the packet available to the forwarding engine.
        response: An optional packet to transmit in reply (e.g. a request
            response or path return); None when no reply is warranted.
