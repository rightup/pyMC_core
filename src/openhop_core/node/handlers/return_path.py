"""Reciprocal return-path teaching for flood-routed replies.

MeshCore servers do **not** derive a reply route by reversing the path an
inbound request arrived on. ``simple_repeater``'s ``MyMesh::onPeerDataRecv``
answers a DIRECT ``PAYLOAD_TYPE_REQ`` out of the per-client ``out_path`` stored
in its ACL::

    if (client->out_path_len != OUT_PATH_UNKNOWN) {
      sendDirect(reply, client->out_path, client->out_path_len, ...);
    } else {
      sendFloodReply(reply, ...);
    }

That ``out_path`` has exactly one writer — ``onPeerPathRecv``, i.e. receiving a
``PAYLOAD_TYPE_PATH`` packet from the client. A client that never sends one
leaves the server replying down whatever route it last stored, which after a
direct login is either nothing (``OUT_PATH_UNKNOWN`` -> flood) or a stale route
from an earlier session (``MyMesh.cpp``: ``if (is_flood) client->out_path_len =
OUT_PATH_UNKNOWN;`` — a *direct* login deliberately does not reset it).

MeshCore's chat client covers this with a self-healing retry
(``BaseChatMesh::onPeerDataRecv`` RESPONSE branch and ``onAckRecv``)::

    if (packet->isRouteFlood() && from.out_path_len != OUT_PATH_UNKNOWN) {
      // we have direct path, but other node is still sending flood response,
      // so maybe they didn't receive reciprocal path properly(?)
      handleReturnPathRetry(from, packet->path, packet->path_len);
    }

A flood reply from a peer we *already* hold a direct ``out_path`` for is the
tell: the peer has no usable route back to us. The fix is to re-teach it with a
``createPathReturn`` sent DIRECT along our own ``out_path``.

openHop previously sent a reciprocal PATH in only one place — on receiving a
flood ``PAYLOAD_TYPE_PATH`` (:mod:`.protocol_response`). That covers a *flood*
login, whose response comes back wrapped in a PATH. It does not cover a login
sent DIRECT (the user-forced-path case), which the server answers with a plain
flood ``RESPONSE``. This module supplies the missing parity.

Deliberate deviations from firmware, each documented at its definition:

* ``RETURN_PATH_COOLDOWN_S`` throttles re-teaching per contact. Firmware has no
  such throttle; openHop adds one so a burst of flood replies cannot turn into a
  burst of transmits.
* Firmware paces its retry with ``sendDirect(..., 3000)`` — a *queued* send whose
  3 s delay is a settle window (``queueOutbound(..., futureMillis(3000))``), not a
  busy wait. openHop honours that window (``RETURN_PATH_SETTLE_S``) in a background
  task rather than inline on the RX path: the injector may block on a TX lock and
  an airtime budget, and awaiting it inline would delay delivery of the very reply
  that triggered the teach, potentially past its own response timeout.
* openHop chooses the teach source across every copy of the flood reply,
  collected pre-dedup via ``note_flood_copy``, and ranks them by **decodability
  rather than signal strength**: a copy's SNR margin over the demodulator limit
  decides whether its link is reliable, and among reliable copies the shortest
  route wins. Firmware embeds whichever copy it processed first, and only its
  (SNR-scored, ships-disabled) reception hold makes that the best one; neither
  firmware mode weighs hop count, so a strong nearby repeater can append itself
  as an extra hop. See ``SF_DEMOD_SNR_LIMIT_DB``,
  ``RETURN_PATH_RELIABLE_MARGIN_DB`` and ``_copy_rank`` for the model and the
  measurements behind it. There is deliberately no cross-reply downgrade guard:
  firmware has none, and a flood reply from a peer we hold an ``out_path`` for is
  by this module's own premise a broken return route, so refusing to re-teach it
  because a newer copy is weaker than a previous (non-working) one would prolong
  the failure.
* The reciprocal teach that follows a flood login cannot wait for that window —
  the peer needs a usable route immediately — so it goes out on the copy in hand
  and then corrects itself once the window closes
  (``maybe_reteach_better_copy``). Firmware never re-teaches, but it is safe
  against firmware: ``onPeerPathRecv`` stores the path with an unconditional
  ``copyPath``, touches no replay watermark, and returns ``false`` so no
  reciprocal bounces back. The correction only transmits when the better copy
  differs, so the common case costs nothing.

Every teach this module sends embeds a path it actually observed. It deliberately
does **not** guess one: an earlier revision, on a request timeout, taught the
reverse of our own ``out_path`` on the assumption that routes are symmetric.
Real routes frequently are not, and ``onPeerPathRecv`` overwrites
``client->out_path`` unconditionally (``BaseChatMesh.cpp``), so a wrong guess
replaced a working route with a dead one and the peer then answered DIRECT into a
void — leaving no flood reply to correct it. The timeout case is handled where the
evidence can actually be obtained instead: the request itself is re-sent as a
flood on retry (``_SendOpsMixin._build_retry_packet``), and the peer answers a
flood request with a PATH-return, which is a real inbound path to teach from.

Not yet covered: firmware also re-teaches from ``onAckRecv``. A discrete ACK on
the wire is a bare 4-byte CRC with no source hash, and openHop's dispatcher
tracks pending ACK CRCs in a plain set with no contact attribution, so there is
nothing to key the re-teach on. Wiring that up needs a CRC->contact map in the
send path; it is not required for the request/response flows this module fixes.

# ~4.2 s one-hop, ~4.8 s flood and ~6.1 s at two hops, so for near contacts the
# second and third retry-driven teaches are suppressed. That is intended — the

RETURN_PATH_COOLDOWN_S = 5.0

# How long to keep collecting copies of a flood reply before teaching from the

# that 3 s is a queued-send "not before" schedule (``queueOutbound(...,
# futureMillis(3000))``) — a settle window, not just pacing.
#
# A flood reply reaches us by several routes, and openHop's dedup, like
# firmware's ``hasSeen``, is "first packet wins". The first copy to arrive is
# NOT the best route -- observed on a live SF7/62.5k mesh, four copies of one
# login reply landed over ~6 s at -102, -62, -41 and -24 dBm, weakest first.
# Teaching from the first copy tells the peer to answer down its most marginal
# link, and its replies then die there while flood replies still get through,
# which looks exactly like the bug this module was written to fix.
#
# Firmware avoids this only when its reception-quality hold is enabled: the hold
# reorders flood processing so the best-scored copy is seen (and marks-seen)
# first, making firmware's embedded ``packet->path`` the best copy. But the hold
# is scored on SNR alone and ships DISABLED (``rx_delay_base`` is memset-zeroed;
# the enabling line is commented "enable once new algo fixed"), so on a stock
# node firmware embeds the first-arrived copy -- and its 3 s delay only defers
# the transmit, it does not re-pick the copy. openHop therefore selects the
# teach source itself, by decodability margin and hop count (see
# ``_copy_rank`` and ``note_flood_copy``), during this window
# instead of leaning on the hold. Unchanged on the wire, strictly better than
# firmware when the hold is off and no worse when it is on.

        A flood reply arrives as several copies over a couple of seconds, but the
        teach it triggers must go out immediately — the peer needs *some* usable
        route, and delaying the reciprocal would delay the login that carries it.
        So the caller teaches from the first-arrived copy and then calls this to
        correct itself once the better copies have landed.

        Teaching twice is safe against firmware. ``simple_repeater``'s
        ``onPeerPathRecv`` (and ``simple_room_server``'s) stores the path with an
        unconditional ``copyPath`` — last write wins, no comparison — touches only
        ``last_activity`` so the REQ replay watermark is unaffected, and returns
        ``false`` with an explicit ``// NOTE: no reciprocal path send!!``, so there
        is no ping-pong. ``Mesh.cpp`` gates its own reciprocal on
        ``isRouteFlood()`` too, and this teach is DIRECT, so even a
        ``BaseChatMesh`` peer will not bounce one back.

        The residual risk is wire-order inversion: ``copyPath`` has no sequence
        number, so if the first (worse) teach somehow landed *after* this one the
        peer would keep the worse route. The settle window's seconds of separation
        make that far beyond normal relay jitter, and this only transmits when the
        route actually differs, so the common case sends nothing at all.
