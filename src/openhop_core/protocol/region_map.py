      ``next_id``, so nothing in ``regions[]`` has id 0 -- but nothing here stops
      an application registering a RegionEntry with id 0, so honour the same
      precedence rather than scoping a reply firmware would have sent plain.
    - ``FLOOD``: firmware sets ``recv_pkt_region = &getWildcard()`` unless the
      wildcard denies flood. Recorded as ``_recv_region_unscoped`` -- the
      requester chose un-scoped, and :func:`apply_reply_scope` mirrors it.
    - Direct, an unresolved transport code, a region with no usable key, or a
      wildcard that denies flood: firmware leaves ``recv_pkt_region`` NULL, which
      is *scope unknowable* rather than *un-scoped*. Both flags stay clear and
      the reply defers to the ordinary send precedence.

    """Scope a freshly-built flood reply per firmware ``chooseReplyScope``.

    Re-hashes the transport code over the reply's own payload -- never copies
    the request's code.

    Rows are :func:`choose_reply_scope`'s, which is the literal firmware
    predicate (``RoutingPolicy.h``); this function decides the two the capture
    can answer on its own and defers the other two:

    1. ``REPLY_SCOPE_REQUEST`` -- captured with a key: scope the reply with it
       and mark the decision final.
    2. ``REPLY_SCOPE_NONE``, un-scoped flood: mirror that and mark it final, so
       a node default cannot scope a reply on a path that demonstrably works
       un-scoped today.
    3/4. ``REPLY_SCOPE_DEFAULT``, and the ``REPLY_SCOPE_NONE`` firmware reaches
       for want of any default: these turn on whether a scope is configured,
       which is the send layer's to know. Return unmarked and let it answer.

    Not captured at all (standalone node, ``region_map`` None) also returns
    unmarked, so the reply falls through to that same precedence.

    Only rows 1 and 2 set ``_flood_scope_applied``. That mark stops the node
    default reaching a reply whose scope *this* helper decided, so the deferring
    rows must not set it.

    Why rows 3 and 4 defer. Firmware splits them by role. A repeater resolves
    DEFAULT as ``sendFloodScoped(default_scope, ...)``
    (``simple_repeater/MyMesh.cpp``), while a companion answers the same case
    with ``sendFloodScoped(recipient, ...)``, which is ``send_unscoped`` first,
    then ``send_scope``, else ``default_scope``
    (``companion_radio/MyMesh.cpp``). One helper here serves both roles, and
    ``Dispatcher._apply_flood_scope`` / ``CompanionBase._apply_flood_scope``
    already implement that precedence -- including firmware's final NONE, since
    a node with nothing configured leaves the packet a plain flood. Deciding
    here would duplicate the chain and, by marking the packet, suppress it: an
    operator's explicit-unscoped flag and transient override would both be
    silently overridden. It would also bind the reply to the default as it
    stood at RX rather than at TX.

    Caller contract: the reply must reach the radio through one of those two
    resolvers. Every send path in this tree does -- a handler reply travels
    ``Dispatcher.send_packet``, and a ``CompanionBridge`` reply travels the
    host's packet injector, which for the repeater ends at the same call. An
    application that serializes a deferred reply straight to a radio would put
    it on air plain.

    Known divergence, deliberate: rows 3 and 4 reach a precedence that also
    honours the transient override and the explicit-unscoped flag, because the
    companion role requires it. Firmware's *repeater* has neither concept, so a
    node holding a RegionMap and an override but no default would send the
    reply scoped where firmware's repeater sends it plain. No topology here
    reaches that state -- ``CompanionBridge`` never writes those dispatcher
    fields, and a ``CompanionRadio`` owns its own dispatcher, where honouring
    them is the correct companion behaviour.

    Replying un-scoped in rows 3/4 is the bug MeshCore PR #3106 fixed: a
    repeater on the way back running ``flood.max.unscoped=0`` drops such a reply
    at hop 0. The fix is that a configured default now reaches it -- which it
    does through the send layer.
