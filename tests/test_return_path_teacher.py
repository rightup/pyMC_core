"""Return-path teaching parity with MeshCore's BaseChatMesh::handleReturnPathRetry.

A MeshCore server answers a DIRECT request from the ``out_path`` stored in its
ACL, never by reversing the inbound path. A client that never teaches that route
leaves the server replying into a dead route, which is what breaks CLI/protocol
requests over a user-forced path: the login goes out DIRECT, so the server
answers with a plain flood RESPONSE rather than the flood PATH that normally
carries the reciprocal, and nothing else in the stack teaches the route back.
